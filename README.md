# Welcome to my Git and GitHub explanation repo.
In this repository, I will compile my knowledge about **Git** and **GitHub** to create a comprehensive reference for anyone needing a quick guide—a detailed cheat sheet for newcomers. The idea originated from a good friend who asked for tips about these tools, and I thought it would be beneficial for both of us to document this information. 

[!Note]
If you are willing to contribute to improving and expanding this humble guide, by all means, go ahead! Your contributions are welcome.

**Without further ado, let's jump in.**

# Git & GitHub - Know the difference.
Before we begin, I'd like to make the somewhat pedantic distinction between Git and GitHub. 
- Git is the version control system you install on your device (computer).
- GitHub is the web-based platform where you can store and manage your Git repositories.
   
Git is a versatile tool that can be used not only with GitHub but also in a variety of other configurations. For example, a company might manage its codebase through a strictly local repository, allowing employees to collaborate internally without relying on an external hub. Similarly, a solo developer might use Git solely on their own PC for personal projects, choosing not to upload their files to any external service. 

To use Git, you'll need to install it on your system. The installation process varies depending on your operating system and distribution—whether you're using Linux or Windows. But you probably already knew that.

# Git and Github - File areas
Git and Github manage files by putting them in four separate 'areas'. It is important to understand these areas so not to cause any trouble when working with repositories. There are 4 areas in which the files of your code can reside. 

![book](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48145eed-e5bc-400e-a194-9846997c761b)

1. Working directory.
2. Staging area.
3. Local repository.
4. Remote repository.

# Working with repositories.
To work with a repository we have to either initialize it  locally or clone it from a remote origin. 

To initialize a repository locally we must use the `git init <repo> ` command, and to clone a remote repository we use the `git clone <repo>` command.

## Git init
Git init is the command that initializes a new empty repository on your local working directory. In order to do that we must use the following command.
`git init name-of-repo`
This will create a new repository without any files in it aside from **.git/** directory.

## Git clone


# TODO
The following concepts will be here documented and elucidated.

# Branches
